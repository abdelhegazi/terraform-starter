When checking out AWs project
Make sure you add your own AWS_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY within provider.tf as I added XXXXXXXXXXXX as a place holder for my personal ones.

I personally use Environmental variables for azure, AWS 


bear in mind these are the names of the env variable when using azure, this is defined in my ~/.bashrc

BTW, these are proven working for AZURE provisioning on (MAC, Linux), I don't think that I am a windows user, export these following  env vars and you are set

 ARM_CLIENT_ID="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
 ARM_CLIENT_NAME="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
 ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX="
 ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 ARM_TENANT_ID="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
